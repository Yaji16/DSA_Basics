Input:
wordList = {"des","der","dfr","dgt","dfs"}
startWord = "der", targetWord = "dfs"
Output:
3
Explanation: 
The length of the smallest transformation sequence from "der" to 
"dfs" is 3 i.e.
 "der" -> (replace ‘e’ by ‘f’) -> "dfr" -> (replace ‘r’ by ‘s’)  -> "dfs". 
So, it takes 3 different strings for us to reach the targetWord. 
Each of these strings are present in the wordList.

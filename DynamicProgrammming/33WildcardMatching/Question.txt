We are given two strings ‘S1’ and ‘S2’. String S1 can have the following two special characters:

‘?’ can be matched to a single character of S2.
‘*’ can be matched to any sequence of characters of S2. (sequence can be of length zero or more).
We need to check whether strings S1 and S2 match or not.We are given two strings S1 and S2, we want to know how many distinct subsequences of S2 are present in S1.

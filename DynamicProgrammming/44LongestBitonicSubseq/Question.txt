Given an array, ‘Arr’ of length ‘n’, find the longest bitonic subsequence.

Let us first understand what a bitonic subsequence means.

A bitonic subsequence is a subsequence of an array in which the elements can be any of these three:

First, increase till a point and then decrease.
Goes on increasing (Longest increasing subsequence)
Goes on decreasing (Longest decreasing subsequence)

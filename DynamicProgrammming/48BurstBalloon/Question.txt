You are given n balloons, indexed from 0 to n – 1. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by an array. You are asked to burst all the balloons.

If you burst the ith balloon, you will get arr[i – 1] * arr[i] * arr[i + 1] coins. If i – 1 or i + 1 goes out of the array’s bounds, then treat it as if there is a balloon with a 1 painted on it.

Return the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.

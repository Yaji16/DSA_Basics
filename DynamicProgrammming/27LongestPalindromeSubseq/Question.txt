A palindromic string is a string that is equal to its reverse. For example: “Nitin” is a palindromic string. Now the question states to find the length of the longest palindromic subsequence of a string. It is that palindromic subsequence of the given string with the greatest length.
We need to print the length of the longest palindromic subsequence.

Given a string 's' and a dictionary of strings wordDict, return true if s can be segmented into a space separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.
Note: Some word in dictionary can be reused multiple times.

e.g. s = "leetcode" wordDict = ["leet", "code"] - True
     s = "applepenapple" wordDict = ["apple", "pen"] - True
     s="catsanddog"    wordDict = ["cats", "dog", "sand", "and", "cat"] - False

Given a double x and integer n, calculate x raised to power n. Basically Implement pow(x, n).

Example 1:

Input: x = 2.00000, n = 10

Output: 1024.00000

Explanation: You need to calculate 2.00000 raised to 10 which gives ans 1024.00000

Example 2:

Input: x = 2.10000, n = 3

Output: 9.26100

Explanation: You need to calculate 2.10000 raised to 3 which gives ans 9.26100
